= LB8685: Accelerating Infrastructure Modernization with OpenShift Virtualization

Welcome to *Red Hat One*! 

Many of our labs are intended to demonstrate OpenShift Virtualization as a technology or demonstrate some basic featuresets or operations in the environment to assuage the concerns of customers that are new to the platform entirely or have a basic understanding of the OpenShift Platform. Many of these customers are migrating from a traditional hypervisor where virtualization is their only concern, and the concept of modernization by integrating other technologies and workflows has never crossed their mind. Thus we have the promary purpose of this lab, which is to demonstrate the use of OpenShift Virtualization from a modernized point of view, using new tools and integrations such as OpenShift Lightspeed, and actual workflows using virtual machines and containers to demonstrate how these two technologies can be leveraged together in the application lifecycle. This also includes demonstrations of how concepts of advanced networking, policy-driven operations, and version-controlled configurations can help realize a modernized approach to working with virtual machines and the applications that depend on them.

[[value-prop]] 

== Why use containers and virtualization together?


== Why use GitOps to deploy virtualized environments?


== How does a Service Mesh affect the way my applications function?


== How can I extend operations at the user level for self-service?


== Where can I learn more about the multicloud operations for OpenShift Virtualization? 

[[lab-summary]]

These are four main modules that will be covered in this lab, as well as two additional interactive video modules that will be expanded upon in the future:

*VM Foundations with OpenShift Lightspeed*: 

- Attendees will review OpenShift Virtualization basics, and explore how OpenShift Lightspeed can make their jobs easier through assistance with troubleshooting and provisioning workloads.

*Service Mesh Integration*:

- Attendees will deploy an application that makes use of both containers and virtual machines along with service mesh for advanced network metrics in a modernized approach to application management.

*Enhanced Security with Service Mesh*:

- Attendees will learn how the integration of a service mesh can help improve security for applications when deployed within OpenShift.

*GitOps Automation*:

- Attendees will deploy an application that makes use of GitOps for configuration and application deployment and management.

*OpenShift Virtualization with Developer Hub*:

- This interactive video module will demonstrate some features of using Developer Hub to provision and manage virtual machine workloads.

*OpenShift Virtualization in the Cloud*:

- This interactive video module will demonstrate the deployment and management of OpenShift Virtualization in a number of supported cloud providers.

== Openshift Cluster Environment

[IMPORTANT]
====
You will be using a *shared* OpenShift cluster with OpenShift Virtualization, OpenShift Service Mesh and other components *already installed*. In this lab you are going to explore and leverage these services, but not install them.
====

== Requirements for the Lab Environment

* Please read all instructions carefully when carrying out assigned tasks and do not only focus on the images provided.
* If you are stuck and need assistance, please raise your hand and a proctor will see to you as soon as possible.
* Each participant needs to have their own computer with a web browser and internet access.
* A Chromium-based browser is recommended for the best experience.

== Lab Instructions and Commands

Here is an overview of the different types of instructions you'll find throughout the lab.

[source,shell,subs=attributes,role=execute]
----
echo 'This is a shell command you should execute in the terminal. 
You can copy the command with the icon on the right'
----

[source,shell,subs=attributes]
----
echo 'This is a shell command or shell output. 
But nothing you need to execute.'
----

====
This is an example instruction using your web browser or OpenShift Web Console.
Just follow the instructions in this box.
====


== Lab Login

Use the following details to log in:

* **Console:** link:{modernize_ocp_virt_console_url}[window=blank]
* **Username:** {modernize_ocp_virt_username}
* **Password:** {modernize_ocp_virt_password}

Also you can authenticate to your cluster via the embedded terminal, you can copy/paste the following command:

[source,shell,subs=attributes,role=execute]
----
{login command}
----

[[lab-assets]]
== Lab Assets

As the last part of this introduction section, you are asked to download and extract a couple of assets and scripts that will be used in the later lab sections.

You have an integrated terminal on your right hand side, use it to clone the provided repository with the commands shown below:

[source,shell,subs=attributes,role=execute]
----
git clone {modernize_ocp_virt_repo}
----

List your cloned directory and see if all the assets are available:

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
ls -la modernize-ocp-virt-workspace
----

At your leisure you can explore the contents of this repo, but now that the introduction is complete, lets get started with the lab.
