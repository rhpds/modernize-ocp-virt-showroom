# Lab Introduction

Welcome to the lab *{lab_name}.*

In this lab you will be using OpenShift as a cluster administrator.
Use the following details to log in.

* **Console:** link:{openshift_cluster_console_url}[window=_blank]
* **Username:** {openshift_cluster_admin_username}
* **Password:** {openshift_cluster_admin_password}

## Objectives

* Understand the lab setup
* Understand the application context

## Lab instructions and commands

Here is an overview of the different types of instructions you'll find throughout the lab. 

[source,shell,subs=attributes,role=execute]
----
echo 'This is a shell command you should execute in the terminal. 
You can copy the command with the icon on the right'
----

[source,shell,subs=attributes]
----
echo 'This is a shell command or shell output. 
But nothing you need to execute.'
----

====
This is an example instruction using your web browser or OpenShift Web Console.
Just follow the instructions in this box.
====

## Lab assets

//Before you begin, access your link:https://codeserver-codeserver-{openshift_cluster_user_name}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[code-server environment,window=_blank] and ensure you have access to the lab assets `ossm-labs`.

// Open a terminal (*`Terminal`* -> *`New Terminal`* from the menu) in the _code-server_ so that you can execute the commands during the labs.

You have a terminal on your right hand side and we have provided you with a repo of assets (scripts) to be used throughout the lab.

Please clone the repository as shown below:

[source,shell,subs=attributes,role=execute]
----
git clone {virt_ossm_workspace_repo}/{virt_ossm_workspace_project}
----

List your cloned directory and see if all the assets are available:

[source,shell,subs=attributes,role=execute]
----
ls -la {virt_ossm_workspace_project}
----

You can go and inspect these resources in this repository at a later stage.

//Although for the labs the assets are made available you can additionally get and inspect these resources at a later stage from the link:https://github.com/redhat-gpte-devopsautomation/ossm-labs[ossm-labs,window=_blank] github repository.

## Openshift Cluster Environment

[IMPORTANT]
====
You will be using a *dedicated OpenShift cluster with OpenShift Virtualization, OpenShift Service Mesh and other components already installed*. In this lab you are going to explore and leverage these services, but not install them.
====

## Travel Demo Application - Use Case

This lab will take you through the use case of a _Travel Agency_ organization which operates a _Travel booking_ application. The company has migrated some existing application components in the form of Virtual Machines to OpenShift Virtualization. 
And some of the application components are already containerized. 

In this lab you are going to expand and extend the capabilities of Virtual Machines in the cloud-native world.
You will be introduced to technologies like Service Mesh and GitOps as well as providing a self-service portal with Red Hat Developer Hub. 

NOTE: Having the Virtual machines running in OpenShift is not the end, it is the beginning of the cloud-native journey.

== Understanding the existing Travel Booking Application

[NOTE]
====
The sample application we use in this Lab is based on the _Kiali Travel Demo Tutorial_: https://kiali.io/docs/tutorials/travels/[https://kiali.io/docs/tutorials/travels/,window=_blank]
====

=== 1. Travel Portal Domain namespace

The Travel Demo application simulates two business domains organized in different namespaces.
In a first namespace called `travel-portal` there will be deployed several travel shops, where users can search for and book flights, hotels, cars or insurance. The shop applications can behave differently based on request characteristics like channel (web or mobile) or user (new or existing). +
These workloads may generate different types of traffic to imitate different real scenarios. All the portals consume a service called `travels` deployed in the `travel-agency` namespace.

[NOTE]
====
The components in this namespace are running as containers.
====

=== 2. Travel Agency Domain namespace

A second namespace called `travel-agency` will host a set of services created to provide quotes for travel. +
A main `travels` service will be the business entry point for the travel agency. It receives a destination city and a user as parameters and it calculates all elements that compose a travel budget: airfare, lodging, car reservation and travel insurance. +
Each service can provide an independent quote and the `travels` service must then aggregate them into a single response. Additionally, some users, like _registered_ users, can have access to special discounts, managed as well by an external service. +

[NOTE]
====
The components in this namespace are running as Virtual Machines.
====

=== 3. Travel Control namespace

The `travel-control` namespace runs a _business dashboard_ with two key features:

* Allow setting changes for every travel shop simulator (traffic ratio, device, user and type of travel).
* Provide a _business_ view of the total requests generated from the `travel-portal` namespace to the `travel-agency` services, organized by business criteria as grouped per shop, per type of traffic and per city.

[NOTE]
====
This component will be running as a Virtual Machine. You are going to deploy it in Module 2.

=== Travel Portal and Travel Agency flow

A typical flow consists of the following steps:

. A portal queries the `travels` service for available destinations,
. `travels` service queries the available `hotels` and returns to the portal shop,
. A user selects a destination and a type of travel, which may include a `flight` and/or a `car`, `hotel` and `insurance`,
.  `Cars`, `Hotels` and `Flights` may have available discounts depending on user type.
